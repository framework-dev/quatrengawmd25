    Initial					time turned sour, left a<br>bad taste, my teeth rotted I<br>ate everything sweet
    Pranavi	rain pours down, ticking clock<br>the unending noise, so loud<br>I hear nothing yet	a taste like no other,<br>i recall the smell of skin,<br>my stomach aches loud	all you left me, no<br>less than numberless sickly<br>stars, and their darkness	My granduer grew, vines<br>of gold, a hunger anew<br>froze my daughter cold	crystal ball told me, look up<br>life exists between<br>stars glistening in the river	the air was once tart.<br>outside of time was tender<br>with a wash of bells	the clock strikes 13<br>cameras pointed, leaves change<br>you are still the same
    Sehee	love escapes the past<br>clouds yellow, behind the trees<br>the bed is ready	my ears turn to felt<br>throat dried by rain and fear<br>here, i am alone	over wave and swell, tones<br>now ring and bring time back to<br>you, myself, to us	Laundry dried, under<br>soft rays of sun, clean<br>my hands wrung, dirt, leaves	leaves likes trees die and<br>fall, if they told me to go<br>I wouldn’t sing twice	It was the first time<br>we met. You my true twinkling<br>infantry of hello.	giants called our names<br>our purpose was to answer<br>intentionally
    TJ	their footsteps were here<br>they say they know what happened<br>I feel the air sing	cicadas fly south<br>my tongue is caught in honey<br>i cannot speak well	falter. leaves falter<br>thoughts falter. flowers falter<br>deliberately	Run down the river,<br>away from the ring, speak<br>with your lies, dont look up	I’ll cover my ears<br>they’ll see me drag you out, the<br>phone rang it’s suckle	I have answered them.<br>Taste on the tongue stayed stale<br>as I grabbed my own arm. 	now walk walk walk walk<br>walking, running, flying, so<br>walk walk, run run, fly
    Isa	the hair falls down, down<br>a strand on my tongue, my head<br>I brush my hair, teeth	the promise of you<br>which prompts god to call your name<br>do not forget this	still they call us, still.<br>great ones call us: not hearing<br>falling silences	but do I know, am<br>I taught? learn where the winds blow<br>dirt, sky, I float, fly	seeping in the sun,<br>lemon picking orchards, I’ll<br>come back for orchids	Let’s all forget now<br>like those on the gallows. I’ll<br>chop everyone’s head off.	There is a life out<br>side of yourself they said<br>and I just taste salt
    Minh Khue	soon I fell asleep.<br>on that lonely cloud is me<br>where do I go now?	am i full of shit?<br>god’s disgrace, eyes without a face<br>leave no past behind	no longer touch or<br>taste, up where sweetness is nothing.<br>flat on my tongue. here	In the bitter sea,<br>time chases, not complacent<br>bleed, my teeth, citrus needs	glass crows, colors go clear<br>I can’t see straight down highway<br>50 ways to dream	with sharp vinegar<br>in my nose. I breathe pale<br>name desolate smell.	and I hit the ground<br>to do life over again<br>so please, just, believe
    Andrew	the trees look bitter<br>the sun a glowing echo<br>when one dies, others grow	my gums taste sour<br>time measured by folds of skin<br>air warm, without sin	the mud is sweet, still<br>time is soured, still. the great air<br>tricked us into fall	Ring the phone, hear your<br>voice, yell, scream the bitterness<br>and watch, decompose	it’s fickle here too<br>I’ll bite, claw through muscle ache<br>for another while	Soon later, murders<br>will lose their screams, words, their meanings.<br>Time passes, a sour taste.	believe time turns sour<br>bells wash as giants falter<br>6th sense deemed senseless`
